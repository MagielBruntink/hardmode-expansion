      STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft are constructed from special alloys with unique properties.  They are extremely light and durable, and can be molded by electro-magnetic methods.  This material can not be reproduced but used in many kinds of manufacturing processes."

      STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft consist of three main components - a power source, a navigation system and a hull built from alien alloys. The hull is specially designed to allow gravity waves to be directed and controlled. In addition a small quantity of Elerium is required to fuel the power source. Once the principles of construction are understood, and the functions of each component are known, then it is possible to build these types of craft, to achieve this, we need to interrogate prisoners with technical and navigational abilities, for long space flights we may need the help of alien Medics."
